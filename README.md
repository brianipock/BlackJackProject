# BlackJackProject
I have 4 classes and 2 enums A test class, a Cards class, a DeckofCards class, and a Hand class.  Two Enums for SUITS and CARDRANK.

The Card class develops the basic shell for what a card will be, it instantiates a Suit, Rank, and value.  This is the framework for our 52 cards in a deck, and the Array is hard coded at 52 as well.
